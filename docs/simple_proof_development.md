# Simple Proof Development: Variational Synthesis in Lean

## Overview

This document develops a simple proof step by step, building on the Lean foundations we've discovered. We'll start with the most basic mathematical statement from the variational synthesis paper and gradually build complexity.

## Starting Point: Basic Langevin Equation Structure

### **Mathematical Statement to Formalize**

From the paper:
> "The evolution of these sparsely coupled states can be expressed as a Langevin or stochastic differential equation: namely, a high dimensional, nonlinear, state-dependent flow plus independent random (Wiener) fluctuations, ùúî, with a variance of 2Œì:"

### **Simplified Version for Initial Proof**

Let's start with a **1-dimensional case** to establish the basic structure:

**Equation**: `dx/dt = f(x) + œâ(t)`

Where:
- `x(t)` is the state variable
- `f(x)` is the state-dependent flow (deterministic part)
- `œâ(t)` is the random fluctuation (stochastic part)
- `œâ(t)` has variance `2Œì`

## Step 1: Define Basic Types and Structures

### **Lean Code Structure**

```lean
-- Basic types for our simple proof
def time := ‚Ñù
def state := ‚Ñù
def flow_function := state ‚Üí state
def noise_function := time ‚Üí state

-- Structure for a simple Langevin equation
structure simple_langevin_equation :=
  (flow : flow_function)
  (noise : noise_function)
  (variance : ‚Ñù)
  (variance_positive : variance > 0)

-- Example: Simple linear flow
def linear_flow : flow_function := Œª x, -x  -- dx/dt = -x (exponential decay)
```

### **What This Establishes**

1. **Basic types** for time, state, and functions
2. **Structure** for a Langevin equation
3. **Simple example** of a flow function

## Step 2: Define the Evolution Equation

### **Mathematical Definition**

We want to formalize: `dx/dt = f(x) + œâ(t)`

### **Lean Implementation**

```lean
-- Define the evolution equation
def evolution_equation (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : state) (t : time) : state :=
  leq.flow x + leq.noise t

-- Define the derivative (simplified - we'll use existing mathlib)
def state_derivative (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : time ‚Üí state) (t : time) : state :=
  evolution_equation leq (x t) t

-- This represents: dx/dt = f(x) + œâ(t)
```

### **What This Establishes**

1. **Evolution equation** combining deterministic and stochastic parts
2. **State derivative** that represents the full equation
3. **Connection** between the mathematical notation and Lean code

## Step 3: Prove Basic Properties

### **Property 1: Deterministic Part is Well-Defined**

```lean
-- Prove that the flow function is well-defined for all states
theorem flow_well_defined (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : state) :
  ‚àÉ y : state, y = leq.flow x :=
begin
  -- This should be straightforward since ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù functions are total
  use leq.flow x,
  refl
end
```

### **Property 2: Noise Has Correct Variance Structure**

```lean
-- Define what it means for noise to have variance 2Œì
def noise_has_variance (leq : simple_langevin_equation) : Prop :=
  -- This is a simplified version - in reality we'd need measure theory
  -- For now, we'll just state the property
  leq.variance = 2 * leq.variance / 2

-- Prove this property holds
theorem noise_variance_property (leq : simple_langevin_equation) :
  noise_has_variance leq :=
begin
  -- This is a simple arithmetic proof
  rw noise_has_variance,
  rw leq.variance_positive,
  -- Use existing Lean arithmetic
  ring
end
```

## Step 4: Connect to Existing Lean Foundations

### **Using mathlib4 Analysis**

```lean
-- Import existing analysis
import analysis.calculus.deriv

-- Define that our state function is differentiable
def state_differentiable (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : time ‚Üí state) : Prop :=
  ‚àÄ t : time, differentiable_at ‚Ñù x t

-- This connects our simple structure to existing Lean analysis
```

### **Using grundbegriffe Stochastic Foundations**

```lean
-- Import stochastic foundations (when we examine grundbegriffe)
-- import grundbegriffe.stochastic_process

-- Define noise as a stochastic process
def noise_as_stochastic_process (leq : simple_langevin_equation) : Prop :=
  -- This will be defined once we examine the grundbegriffe repository
  true  -- Placeholder for now
```

## Step 5: Prove the Basic Evolution Property

### **Mathematical Statement**

We want to prove that our evolution equation has the right structure.

### **Lean Proof**

```lean
-- Prove that the evolution equation has the right form
theorem evolution_equation_structure (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : state) (t : time) :
  evolution_equation leq x t = leq.flow x + leq.noise t :=
begin
  -- This should be straightforward by definition
  rw evolution_equation,
  refl
end

-- Prove that the derivative connects to the evolution equation
theorem derivative_evolution_connection (leq : simple_langevin_equation) (x : time ‚Üí state) (t : time) :
  state_derivative leq x t = evolution_equation leq (x t) t :=
begin
  -- This should be straightforward by definition
  rw state_derivative,
  rw evolution_equation,
  refl
end
```

## Next Steps: Building Complexity

### **Phase 1: Extend to Vector Case**
- Define `state := fin n ‚Üí ‚Ñù` for n-dimensional states
- Extend flow function to vector-valued functions
- Add matrix operations for variance

### **Phase 2: Add Stochastic Properties**
- Use grundbegriffe for proper stochastic process definitions
- Define Wiener processes and their properties
- Add measure theory for proper variance calculations

### **Phase 3: Add Nonlinear Dynamics**
- Extend flow functions to include nonlinear terms
- Add stability analysis using existing Lean analysis
- Connect to variational principles

## Questions for Next Steps

1. **Should we examine grundbegriffe** to integrate proper stochastic foundations?
2. **Should we extend to the vector case** to match your paper's "high dimensional" requirement?
3. **Should we add specific flow functions** that match your biological applications?
