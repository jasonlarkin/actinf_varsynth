-- Summary: We have successfully formalized the basic structure of a Langevin equation
-- This demonstrates that Lean can handle the mathematical framework needed for
-- the variational synthesis project

-- Next steps would be:
-- 1. Extend to vector case (state := fin n → ℝ)
-- 2. Integrate with grundbegriffe for proper stochastic processes
-- 3. Add nonlinear dynamics and stability analysis
-- 4. Connect to variational principles
